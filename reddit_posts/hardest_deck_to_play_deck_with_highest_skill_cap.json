YGO vs MTG. I know this isn't your central argument, but MTG has fewer cards in the virtual pool than YGO because of set rotations.\n\n2. In the second and third paragraph, you're talking about the virtual card pool. That's a fair point that the virtual card pool is only a fraction of the actual card pool, but even if you take the virtual one, you're still looking at more than 16 different pieces. At the end of the day, it's chess with 16 pieces but longer sequences to memorizes, and ygo with more pieces and shorter sequences but you have to learn new sequences every month.\n\n3. Regarding your point that the bulk of ygo is now googleable. The fact that most ygo formats are solved is precisely why the game is so difficult. My point about no other player coming close to 8 wins ties back to this - as information becomes more easily available for the average player, as the number of good players increases, and as formats become more quickly solved, the opportunities for one individual to win multiple tournaments by breaking the format declines. Barring significant changes to the rules or to organized play, it's unlikely that any player will do what Pat did in '13 - '15 again, because it's so hard to break the game now.\n\n4. Re: the final comparison, I understand the rationale behind, \"the more difficult game should be the one that has higher average skill level.\" Working under that framework, chess would be deemed more difficult. However, the community of participants is largely defined by the culture surrounding the game. Exposure makes a huge impact. Society is exposed to ygo through a children's television show. Society is exposed to chess through all forms of medium, and it is presented with a tremendously different stigma than ygo. It would follow, then, that the type of person who picks up chess is going to differ from the type of person who picks up ygo. The average chess player comes from a better background, and enters into a competitor form with more structured organized play, where society deems the game as more of a gentleman's sport, where monetary rewards are better, where building a career as a player is feasible, and where there have been many many more decades for literature to be published on the game. Ygo players are not afforded much of this, if any at all, and even then, they have more room to figure out good tactics on their own because the game is still in its infancy. You're right that the best duelists wouldn't make it to chess masters, but it's important to recognize the ocean of factors besides just the inherent difficulty of the game that make this so.

I know this isn&amp;#39;t your central argument, but MTG has fewer cards in the virtual pool than YGO because of set rotations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second and third paragraph, you&amp;#39;re talking about the virtual card pool. That&amp;#39;s a fair point that the virtual card pool is only a fraction of the actual card pool, but even if you take the virtual one, you&amp;#39;re still looking at more than 16 different pieces. At the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s chess with 16 pieces but longer sequences to memorizes, and ygo with more pieces and shorter sequences but you have to learn new sequences every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding your point that the bulk of ygo is now googleable. The fact that most ygo formats are solved is precisely why the game is so difficult. My point about no other player coming close to 8 wins ties back to this - as information becomes more easily available for the average player, as the number of good players increases, and as formats become more quickly solved, the opportunities for one individual to win multiple tournaments by breaking the format declines. Barring significant changes to the rules or to organized play, it&amp;#39;s unlikely that any player will do what Pat did in &amp;#39;13 - &amp;#39;15 again, because it&amp;#39;s so hard to break the game now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re: the final comparison, I understand the rationale behind, &amp;quot;the more difficult game should be the one that has higher average skill level.&amp;quot; Working under that framework, chess would be deemed more difficult. However, the community of participants is largely defined by the culture surrounding the game. Exposure makes a huge impact. Society is exposed to ygo through a children&amp;#39;s television show. Society is exposed to chess through all forms of medium, and it is presented with a tremendously different stigma than ygo. It would follow, then, that the type of person who picks up chess is going to differ from the type of person who picks up ygo. The average chess player comes from a better background, and enters into a competitor form with more structured organized play, where society deems the game as more of a gentleman&amp;#39;s sport, where monetary rewards are better, where building a career as a player is feasible, and where there have been many many more decades for literature to be published on the game. Ygo players are not afforded much of this, if any at all, and even then, they have more room to figure out good tactics on their own because the game is still in its infancy. You&amp;#39;re right that the best duelists wouldn&amp;#39;t make it to chess masters, but it&amp;#39;s important to recognize the ocean of factors besides just the inherent difficulty of the game that make this so.

A simpler rebuttal you can give to those who say Yugioh is easy is to ask, \"Then why haven't you won a premier event championship yet?\"\n\nEveryone in the comments section is thinking about the matter incorrectly by only talking about technical play, but it's understandable because the original question only asks about technical play. However, that leaves out an entire other component of the game, deckbuilding in unsolved formats. This skill, and NOT technical play, has the largest influence on the outcome of premier events. It can't be ignored. It is also why it's completely misleading to say that games like chess are more difficult because they involve longer decision trees. Chess may be more difficult in technical play than Yugioh in technical play, but that doesn't mean it is the more difficult game overall. You would have to compare technical play in chess vs. technical play AND deckbuilding in Yugioh for a truly fair comparison. Because the rules to chess never change, it is a 99.9% solved metagame. The demand for innovation is nonexistent except at the very highest levels of play. You can give a child a book and teach him to play at what would be considered grandmaster level 100 years ago. You cannot do this with Yugioh in an unsolved format.\n\nTalking about the skill cap of Yugioh without talking about deckbuilding in unsolved formats is a misrepresentation of how complex the game actually is. If you think decision trees involving 16 chess pieces are large, consider that deck building is a decision tree involving thousands of pieces. The highest ranked player has 8 wins, all achieved through solving the game through deck building. Nobody else has 8, or even 7. Until this year, nobody else even had 6. Deckbuilding is a skill factor that cannot be ignored.\n\nEven that aside, the technical play aspect of Yugioh is still highly difficult. You have to memorize combo variations, just like memorizing long sequences of options in chess. To give one small example, I took a deck to UDS Orlando this fall that averaged 40 discrete moves every opening hand. Also like in chess, you have to calculate percentages in order to play perfectly when facing down binary decisions. I'd wager that there is a single-digit number of people out of the 64,000 in this subreddit community who intuitively and consistently do this at the premier event level. Another detail to chew on when contemplating the technical difficulty of the game is the fact that the best of the best still make mistakes. If Yugioh were truly easy technical play-wise, then the highest ranked players wouldn't still be messing up.\n\nTo answer the other question, hardest deck to play... The question gets asked on a weekly basis here, and the typical answers are: D/D/D, Nekroz, Dragon Ruler. This is not counting the many contrived and degenerate FTK loop decks. The FTK synchro deck that Chris made popular might be the most difficult competitive deck to play of all time. Fun fact, he read through the entire card pool of 7,000+ cards twice in order to think of the cards for it. As far as regular competitive decks go, I'd personally vote for D/D/D.
